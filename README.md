# GTools
A utilties library I made for Unity with some helper functions such as Vector directions and adding a typing effect to TextMeshPro

## How to use:
1. Create a folder in your unity project called *Plugins*
2. Place the DLL file in the *Plugins* folder
3. Use the GTools namespace in your Unity scripts
